### **Part 1: Git Basics**

#### **Task 1: Install and Configure Git**
1. Install Git from [git-scm.com](https://git-scm.com/).  

2. Configure your global Git settings:  
   ```bash
   git config --global user.name "Your Name"
   git config --global user.email "your-email@example.com"
   ```
3. Verify the configuration:  
   ```bash
   git config --list
   ```
```
Explaination :-  git config: This is the command to configure Git settings.

--global: This applies the configuration globally to all repositories on your system.

user.name: This is the key to configure the username.

user.email: This is the Key to Configure the email.
```

#### **Task 2: Initialize a Repository**
1. Create a directory and initialize it as a Git repository:  
   ```bash
   mkdir MyProject
   cd MyProject
   git init
   ```
   - **Purpose**: Initializes a `.git` folder to track changes.

---
```
Explaination :- mkdir: This is the Command is used to Create New Folder.

cd: This is the Command is used to move into any Folder.

git init: This Initialize the current folder as Repository. After Initialize, a hidden .git folder apper in the directory. 
```

### **Part 2: Basic Workflow**

#### **Task 3: Creating and Committing Files**
1. Create a file:  
   ```bash
   echo "Hello Git" > file1.txt
   ```
2. Stage and commit the file:  
   ```bash
   git add file1.txt
   git commit -m "Initial commit: Added file1.txt"
   ```
   ```
   Explaination :-  echo "Hello Git" > file1.txt : This command creates a new file named file1.txt and writes the text "Hello Git" into it. 

   git add . : This Command Stage all chnages in the directory and Track all the files.

   git commit: This Command save a screenshot of the current state of your Repository.
   -m : Allow you to add commit message .

   ```

#### **Task 4: Viewing Changes**
1. Modify the file:  
   ```bash
   echo "Git is awesome!" >> file1.txt
   ```
2. Check file status and differences:  
   ```bash
   git status
   git diff
   ```
   ```
   Explaination :- >>: Unlike >, this appends the text to the file without overwriting its existing content.

   git status: This command shows the current state of your working directory and staging area.

   git diff: This command displays the differences between the working directory and the staging area.

#### **Task 5: Undoing Changes**
1. Unstage a staged file:  
   ```bash
   git reset file1.txt
   ```
2. Discard uncommitted changes:  
   ```bash
   git checkout -- file1.txt
   ```
   ```
   Explaination :- git reset: This command is used to unstage a file that was previously added to the staging area using git add.

   git checkout -- : This command is used to discard uncommitted changes in a specific file and restore it to its last committed state.
   ```

### **Part 3: Branching and Merging**

#### **Task 6: Branch Management**
1. Create a branch and switch to it:  
   ```bash
   git checkout -b feature-branch
   ```
2. List branches:  
   ```bash
   git branch
   ```
3. Rename a branch:  
   ```bash
   git branch -m feature-branch feature-enhanced
   ```
   ```
   Explaination :- git checkout -b <name>: This Command create new branch and switch into it in one step.
   
   git branch: This command lists all the branches in your Git repository.

   git branch <old name> <new name>: This command rename an exsisting branch.
   ```
   

#### **Task 7: Merging Branches**
1. Merge `feature-enhanced` into `main`:  
   ```bash
   git checkout main
   git merge feature-enhanced
   ```
   ```
   git checkout <branch name>: This command sitwch from current branch to another branch.

   git merge: The git merge command is used to combine the work of one branch into another.
   ```

#### **Task 8: Handling Merge Conflicts**
1. Create two conflicting branches and resolve a conflict manually:  
   ```bash
   git merge <branch-name>
   ```
2. Use:  
   ```bash
   git add <resolved-file>
   git commit
   ```
   ```
   Expalination :- git merge <branch-name>: Merges the specified branch into the current branch. If there are conflicting changes, Git marks the files in conflict for manual resolution.

   git add <resolved-file>: Stages the resolved file after conflicts are resolved manually.

   git commit: Creates a new commit recording the resolution of the conflict.
   ```

### **Part 4: Remote Repositories**

#### **Task 9: Remote Setup**
1. Add a remote repository:  
   ```bash
   git remote add origin https://github.com/your-username/repo.git
   ```
2. Verify the remote:  
   ```bash
   git remote -v
   ```
   ```
   Explaination :- git remote add origin: This command adds a remote repository to your local Git repository. The remote repository is where your code can be pushed or pulled from.

   git remote: Lists all remote repositories linked to your local repository.
   -v: Displays detailed information about each remote repository, including the URLs used for fetching and pushing.
   ```
#### **Task 10: Push and Pull**
1. Push changes to the remote repository:  
   ```bash
   git push -u origin main
   ```
2. Pull changes from the remote:  
   ```bash
   git pull origin main
   ```
   ```
   Explaination :- git push: Sends your local changes to the remote repository.
   -u: 
   origin: The name of the remote repository.
   main: The branch in your local repository being pushed to the corresponding branch in the remote repository.

   git pull: Fetches updates from the remote repository and merges them into your current local branch.
   origin: The name of the remote repository from which updates are fetched.
   main: The branch you want to pull changes from.
   ```

#### **Task 11: Cloning a Repository**
1. Clone a remote repository:  
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/repo.git
   ```
   ```
   Explaination :-  git clone: This command copies the repository from the Remote server to Local Machine.

### **Part 5: Advanced Git**

#### **Task 12: Stashing Changes**
1. Save uncommitted changes:  
   ```bash
   git stash
   ```
2. Apply stashed changes:  
   ```bash
   git stash apply
   ```
3. Drop the stash:  
   ```bash
   git stash drop
   ```
   ```
   Explaination :- git stash: Temporarily saves (or stashes) the changes made in the working directory and staging area, then reverts the files to the last committed state.
   
   git stash apply: Applies the most recent stash (stash@{0}) back to the working directory without removing it from the stash list.

   git stash drop: Removes the most recent stash (stash@{0}) from the stash list.
   ```

#### **Task 13: Tagging Commits**
1. Create and annotate a tag:  
   ```bash
   git tag -a v1.0 -m "Version 1.0 release"
   ```
2. Push the tag to the remote:  
   ```bash
   git push origin v1.0
   ```
   ```
   Explaination :- git tag: This command creates a tag on the current commit.
   -a v1.0: The -a flag specifies that you`re creatinf an annotated tag .The v1.0 is the name of the tag.

   -m "Version 1.0 release": This provides a message for the tag.

   git push origin v1.0: This command pushes the tag (v1.0) to the remote repository.

#### **Task 14: Rewriting Commit History**
1. Use interactive rebase to modify commit messages:  
   ```bash
   git rebase -i HEAD~3
   ```
   - Replace `pick` with `edit` or `squash` as needed.
   ```
   Explaination :- git rebase -i: The -i flag stand for Interactive rebaseb,which allows you to manipulate commits.
   HEAD~3: HEAD~3 means 3 commits before the current commit.
   ```

#### **Task 15: Cherry-Picking Commits**
1. Apply a specific commit to another branch:  
   ```bash
   git cherry-pick <commit-hash>
   ```
   ```
   Explaination :- git cherry-pick <commit-hash>: This command takes the changes introduced by the commit with the specified <commit-hash> and applies those changes to your current working branch as a new commit. 
   ```

### **Part 6: Collaboration**

#### **Task 16: Forking and Pull Requests**
1. Fork a repository and clone it locally:  
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/forked-repo.git
   ```
2. Make changes and push them:  
   ```bash
   git checkout -b fix-typo
   echo "Typo fixed" >> README.md
   git commit -m "Fixed a typo"
   git push origin fix-typo
   ```
3. Open a pull request on GitHub.
   ```
   Explaination :- Fork: Forking a repository on GitHub creates a copy of someone else's repository under your own GitHub account.

   git clone <forked-repo-url>: This command clones your forked repository from GitHub to your local machine. 

   git checkout -b <branch-name> : This command creates a new branch and switches to it.

   echo "Typo Fixed" >> README.md: This command adds the text "Typo fixed" to the end of the README.md file.

   git add README.md: Stages the README.md file for committ.

   git commit -m "Fixed a typo": Commits the staged changes, with a message.

   git push origin fix-typo: This command pushes fix-typo branch and its changes the fork on GitHub.
   ```

   #### **Task 17: Simulating Team Collaboration**
   1. Simulate a conflict by having two users modify the same file.

   2. Practice resolving the conflict as a team.
   
   Explaination :- 1. Create two branches:
   ```
   git branch branch-A
   git branch branch-B
   ```
   2. Modify the same line in README.md in both branches.

   3. Merge branch-A into main:
   ```
   git checkout main
   git merge branch-A
   ```
   4. Attempt to merge branch-B into main (this will cause a conflict):
   ```
   git merge branch-B 
   ```
   5. Resolve the conflict manually in README.md, then:
   ```
   git add README.md
   git commit -m "Resolved merge conflict between branch-A and branch-B"
   ```

### **Part 7: Ignoring Files**

#### **Task 18: Using .gitignore**
1. Create a `.gitignore` file:  
   ```bash
   echo "node_modules/" > .gitignore
   git add .gitignore
   git commit -m "Added .gitignore"
   ```
2. Verify that ignored files are not staged:  
   ```bash
   git status
   ```
   ```
   Explanation :-  echo "node_modules/" > .gitignore: This command creates a .gitignore file and adds the line node_modules/ to it.

   git add .: The command stages all changes in the current directory for commit.

   git commit -m "":

   git status: This command shows the current state of your working directory and staging area.
   ```

### **Part 8: Automation and Cleanup**

#### **Task 19: Cleaning the Repository**
1. Remove untracked files:  
   ```bash
   git clean -f
   ```
   ```
   Explanation :- git clean -f: This command is used to remove untracked files from your working directory.
   ```

#### **Task 20: Aliases and Shortcuts**
1. Create an alias for frequently used commands:  
   ```bash
   git config --global alias.st status
   git config --global alias.cm commit
   ```
2. Use the alias:  
   ```bash
   git st
   git cm -m "Message"
   ```
   ```
   Explanation :- git config: Modifies Git's configuration files.
   --global: Applies the configuration globally for all repositories on your system.

   alias.st: Creates a shortcut for the git status command. After this, you can type git st instead of git status.

   alias.cm: Creates a shortcut for the git commit command. After this, you can type git cm instead of git commit.
   
   git st: Execute the git status.

   git cm -m "M": Execute the git commit im "message".
   ```
